| :warning: WARNING          |
|:---------------------------|
| **This plugin, based on the legacy BitPay API and has been discontinued and will only receive security updates. While it will continue to work just fine it won't get any new features. We encourage you use our more modern and actively developed [BTCPay for WooCommerce V2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/btcpay-greenfield-for-woocommerce/) plugin that builds on top of the more feature rich BTCPay Server Greenfield API.**  |



## Quick Start Guide

To get up and running with our plugin quickly, see the GUIDE here: https://docs.btcpayserver.org/integrations/woocommerce

## Brief Description

Add the ability to accept bitcoin in WooCommerce via BTCPayServer.
This plugin is also available through the [wordpress store](https://wordpress.org/plugins/btcpay-for-woocommerce/).

## Detail Description

Bitcoin is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network allows for a highly resilient value transfer infrastructure, and this allows merchants to gain greater profits.

This is because there are little to no fees for transferring Bitcoins from one person to another. Unlike other payment methods, Bitcoin payments cannot be reversed, so once you are paid you can ship! No waiting days for a payment to clear.

## Troubleshooting

1. Ensure a valid SSL certificate is installed on your server. Also ensure your root CA cert is updated. If your CA cert is not current, you will see curl SSL verification errors.
2. Verify that your web server is not blocking POSTs from servers it may not recognize. Double check this on your firewall as well, if one is being used.
3. Check the version of this plugin against the official plugin repository to ensure you are using the latest version. Your issue might have been addressed in a newer version! See the [Releases](https://github.com/btcpayserver/woocommerce-plugin/releases) page for the latest.
4. If all else fails, enable debug logging in the plugin options and open an issue or contact the [community](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver#-community).

**TIP**: When contacting support it will help us is you provide:

* WordPress and WooCommerce Version
* Other plugins you have installed
  * Some plugins do not play nice
* Configuration settings for the plugin (Most merchants take screen grabs)
* Any log files that will help
  * Web server error logs
* Screen grabs of error message if applicable.

## build with docker

```
./docker-build.ps1

## Common errors

### SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate

This can come in two conditions:

* Your BTCPayServer is running on a test certificate
* You have not installed root certificates on the wordpress host

In the first case, please, make sure a valid SSL certificates is installed on your BTCPayServer. You can check this is the case by browsing to the BTCPayServer page, and check there is no browser warnings.

In the second case run,

```
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates
```
