== Description ==

BTCPay Server is a free and open-source cryptocurrency payment processor which allows you to receive payments in Bitcoin and altcoins directly, with no fees, transaction cost or a middleman.

BTCPay is a non-custodial invoicing system which eliminates the involvement of a third-party. Payments with BTCPay go directly to your wallet, which increases the privacy and security. Your private keys are never uploaded to the server. There is no address re-use since each invoice generates a new address deriving from your xpubkey.

You can run BTCPay as a self-hosted solution on your own server, or use a third-party host.

The self-hosted solution allows you not only to attach an unlimited number of stores and use the Lightning Network but also become the payment processor for others.

If you previosly used BitPay's plugin, you can very easily migrate and use BTCPay.

This plugin is a fork of https://github.com/bitpay/woocommerce-plugin which in turn is a fork of https://github.com/jaafit/bitpayWoocommerce. We have modified the plugin in order to support alternative bitpay compliant servers and enhance usability and functionality. This plugin should be able to run alongside the original bitpay plugin. 

* Direct, peer-to-peer Bitcoin and altcoin payments
* No transaction fees (other than mining fees by crypto network itself)
* No processing fees
* No middleman
* No KYC
* User has complete control over private keys
* Enhanced privacy (no address re-use, no IP leaks to third parties)

To integrate BTCPay Server into an existing WooCommerce store, follow the steps below.

### 1. Install BTCPay WooCommerce Plugin ###

### 2. Deploy BTCPay Server ###

To launch your BTCPay server, you can self-host it, or use a third party host.

#### 2.1 Self-hosted BTCPay ####

There are various ways to [launch a self-hosted BTCPay](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-doc#deployment). If you do not have technical knowledge, use the [web-wizard method](https://launchbtcpay.lunanode.com) and follow the video below.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjslXYvp8bk

For the self-hosted solutions, you\'ll have to wait for your node to sync fully before proceeding to step 3.

#### 2.2 Third-party host ####

Those who want to test BTCPay out, or are okay with the limitations of a third-party hosting (dependency and privacy, as well as lack of some features) can use a one of many [third-party hosts](ThirdPartyHosting.md).

The video below shows you how to connect your store to such host.

### 3. Pairing the store ###

BTCPay WooCommerce plugin is a bridge between your server (payment processor) and your e-commerce store. No matter if you\'re using a self-hosted or third-party solution from step 2, the pairing process is identical.

Go to your store dashboard. WooCommerce > Settings > Payments. Click BTCPay.

1. In the field, enter the full URL of your host (including the https) – https://btcpay.mydomain.com
2. Click on the generated link which will redirect you back to your BTCPay Server.
3. Click on request pairing
4. Approve the pairing
5. Copy the pairing code
6. Go back to your store and paste the pairing code
7. Click “Pair”
8. When you see the image, it means you successfully paired your server and your store.

The process of pairing a store with BTCPay is explained in a video below, starting at 1:59

###  4. Connecting your wallet ###

No matter if you're using self-hosted or server hosted by a third-party, the process of configuring your wallet is the same.

### 5. Testing the checkout ###

Making a small test-purchase from your own store, will give you a piece of mind. Always make sure that everything is set up correctly before going live. The final video, guides you through the steps of setting a gap limit in your Electrum wallet and testing the checkout process.
